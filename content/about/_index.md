I am a Ph.D. student at [Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science][2] at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
I'm advised by Prof. [Vincent Ng][1] and often collaborate with [Yufang Hou][3].
My research interests are centered around natural language processing and machine learning, 
particularly on bridging anaphora resolution, coreference resolution, and applying them to downstream tasks. 

Interests: Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning.
